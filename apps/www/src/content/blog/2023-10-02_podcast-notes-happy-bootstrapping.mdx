By [Andreas Lehr](https://twitter.com/shakalandy) (üá©üá™) who is the founder of [We Manage](https://we-manage.de/) and also runs a newsletter [allesnurgecloud](https://allesnurgecloud.com/).

> My name is Andreas Lehr and in this podcast, I interview different entrepreneurs every week about their stories.
>
> Bootstrapping, solopreneur, and indie hacker - what does that actually mean? "Bootstrapped" companies are usually self-financed and grow from revenues without any venture capital.
>
> In "Happy Bootstrapping," I talk with founders about the ups and downs of bootstrapping and the unique aspects of this type of business formation.
>
> I am fascinated by the inspiring stories and the constantly changing challenges that define such a founder's life. I want to share these experiences with you and inspire you to implement your own ideas.

## **My Notes**

<Callout icon="‚ÑπÔ∏è">In the order I have listened to the epsides. Not full summaries but just my own personal notes</Callout>

### E21 ‚Äì with Dominik Sobe of [HelpKit.so](http://HelpKit.so)
- Several projects under [Seven Degrees Labs](https://sevendegrees.io)
- [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/sobedominik)
- Mistake: building something for 2-3 months and then launch and fail
- Built MVP of HelpKit.so in 2 days at a hackathon
- Founded LLC in the USA (with the help of another company); tax-wise in Portugal (Lisbon)
- Uses Paddle because dealing with taxes worldwide is difficult with Stripe
- Stack: Nuxt on Netlify, Stripe on Render, Paddle, Postgres on DigitalOcean (bad experience with DB on Render)
- At launch, find your own product bad, otherwise launched too late
- Built-in public is a good idea
- Open Startup is only good at the beginning; quickly encourages imitators
- Uses AI to improve the core product (HelpKit AI)
- Solopreneur by conviction, no co-founders or employees
- Uses "**Engineering as Marketing**": building small tools to promote products; on the same domain
- For digital nomads: stay at least 3-6 months in one place, otherwise, you won't make progress


### E24 ‚Äì with Markus Biel of [maildroppa.com](http://maildroppa.com)
- Email tool because there were already tools and it was verified that it is a relevant market -&gt; **existing tools can verify that there is a market**
- MVP is very difficult; it's necessary to understand the core, the main added value precisely; Markus Biel focused on sending emails and attracted spammers
- Finding employees (including freelancers): have 3 do a task/project simultaneously and continue with the best one if it fits; separate at the first sign of not getting along; maintain the relationship during collaboration
- Tech stack: React, Java, Quarkus, GitLab, MariaDB (wants Postgres), Docker, Digital Ocean
- **As low entry barrier as possible for customers**: e.g., no credit card and not verifying email right away, but only when they really want to send
- Free plan with low quota but all features
- Tips from others can be a good starting point, but in the end, everything/everyone is individual and the market decides: e.g., actually, you shouldn't have a free plan, but it's common in the market and competitors offer it
- Gamechanger: Record videos (like Loom); not just for communication with others but also for yourself


### E2 ‚Äì with Philipp Gl√∂ckler of [Lollipod.de](http://Lollipod.de)
- [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/gloeckler)
- host of [Doppelg√§nger TechTalk Podcast](https://twitter.com/Doppelgaengerio)
- Two businesses (Podcast and Podcast Ad-Platform) mutually support each other
- Advantage of Corporate Job: **You can make mistakes that others pay for**
- **Little money promotes the development of creative solutions**


### E16 ‚Äì with Michael Kamleitner of [swat.io](http://swat.io) & [walls.io](http://walls.io)

<Callout icon="‚ö†Ô∏è" class='mt-2'>From here on I add the actual "Snips" (audio excerpts) for some notes.</Callout>
- 2 companies (swat.io & walls.io) built in the social media marketing field
- swat.io started as a Social Inbox; ~45 employees; M. Kamleitner no longer operationally active
- walls.io offers social media walls (e.g. trade shows, etc.); ~20 employees
- walls.io prototype was coded as a surprise for a birthday party
- Tech Stack: React, PHP, NodeJS, Kubernetes, MySQL and Postgres
- **Product emerged from customer demand** ([üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (19:30 - 19:52)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d656fc15-bd0a-4212-9b55-fb8eec4c975f))
- Companies emerged from the agency and were then spun off
- "Test" products within the company but keep teams clearly separated ([üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (33:31 - 34:23)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c78e12cf-326c-4830-9dbf-bbb8c1588aab))
- Critical dependencies ("make or break", e.g., Twitter API) should be avoided ([üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (01:01:15 - 01:02:25)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/de2e72b7-8ba2-4e58-9f7c-542009a2e29e))
- As a bootstrapper, you need to **find a niche** to compete with VC-funded companies. Undercutting prices is often not possible ([üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (01:05:43 - 01:06:40)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4d53f742-2410-42db-9894-2a2c6f88cdf2))
- Advantages of bootstrapping: making your own decisions, following your own path, setting your own pace, etc.


### E38 - Dividend Calendar as a SaaS Solution - Johannes Kronm√ºller from [divvydiary.com](http://divvydiary.com)
- Biggest challenge: qualitative data; many sources and own algorithms needed ([üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (32:37 - 33:57)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c36e6b88-a4b7-45d1-b39f-e4cda7122226))
- Selling data via API to others
- Tier names are "Penny Pincher" and "Aristocrat" -&gt; **Tier names with meanings for the customer**
- Woman is on parental leave and plans to enter the content business (Instagram) ([üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (58:17 - 59:37)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7e4b8405-17c8-4fde-8163-59ed9e87bcfb))


### E4 ‚Äì with David Pohlmann of [Billbee.io](http://Billbee.io)
- Billbee: Swiss Army knife for everything post-sale (invoices, etc.) in eCommerce (primarily) for small businesses.
- **Created out of personal need** (tool for use with Dawanda).
- Developed **alongside freelance work** -&gt; gradually shifted focus from freelancing to Billbee.
- Small businesses haven't brought in much revenue, but they've been **useful for spreading awareness** [üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (16:05 - 17:25)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8c015b3c-c947-4534-962b-64c60aa53445)
- Initially only organic, no paid marketing.
- The biggest benefit of bootstrapping: no one to answer to; the ability to prioritize employees over profits if needed ([üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (40:30 - 41:21)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5f661458-c742-4bdd-a185-7533ca478328))
- Strong emphasis on employee satisfaction (30h work week).
