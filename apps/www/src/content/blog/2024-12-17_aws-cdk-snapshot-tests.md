When I first encountered snapshot tests, I was skeptical. The concept seemed strange, and their benefits weren't
immediately obvious. But after experiencing their value firsthand, I've become a convert â€“ and here's why I think you
should give them a chance.

## What are Snapshot Tests (in AWS CDK)?

Snapshot tests **capture the output of a system** and save it as a reference "snapshot" file. During subsequent test
runs, new snapshots are compared against this stored reference â€“ **any differences trigger a test failure**. Think of it
as taking a "photograph" of your system's output and comparing future changes against it.

Subsequent runs involve CDK code and CloudFormation to compare with the snapshot, resulting in either a pass or fail outcome.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1734444906658/b009a943-42f2-4eb8-8133-a92756ba9482.png

In AWS CDK, snapshot tests **verify the CloudFormation templates** that CDK generates from your infrastructure code.
Whether you write CDK in TypeScript, Python, or other supported languages, your code ultimately **synthesizes into
CloudFormation templates**. Snapshot testing ensures these templates remain consistent with your intentions.

Consider defining an S3 bucket in CDK â€“ the snapshot test captures all generated CloudFormation properties, from basic
bucket configurations to complex access policies. If a future code change modifies any of these properties unexpectedly,
**the snapshot test fails.**

**Snapshot tests are versatile** â€“ you can write them not only for individual constructs but also for entire CDK stacks,
allowing you to verify your complete infrastructure definition in a single test.

## Why Use Snapshot Tests in AWS CDK?

While snapshot tests might initially seem like a curious approach to testing infrastructure, they offer several
compelling benefits that make them invaluable in AWS CDK development.

### **Low Development Effort**

Writing snapshot tests requires minimal code â€“ often just a few lines. Unlike traditional tests where you must write
explicit assertions for each property, snapshot tests automatically capture and verify all aspects of your
infrastructure. This makes them an excellent return on investment, providing broad coverage with minimal development
overhead.

This is a snapshot test that I have written for my `WebhooksStack`.

```typescript
import { App } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Template } from 'aws-cdk-lib/assertions';
import { config } from '../../config';
import { EventBusStack } from '../event-bus/event-bus-stack';
import { WebhooksStack } from './webhooks-stack';

describe('WebhooksStack', () => {
	it('should match the snapshot', () => {
		// ARRANGE
		const app = new App();

		const eventBusStack = new EventBusStack(app, 'EventBus', config);
		const webhooksStack = new WebhooksStack(app, 'Webhooks', {
			...config,
			eventBus: eventBusStack.eventBus,
		});

		// ACT
		const template = Template.fromStack(webhooksStack);

		// ASSERT
		expect(template.toJSON()).toMatchSnapshot();
	});
});
```

It just creates a CDK `App`, instantiates the `WebhooksStack` (and its dependencies), generates the CloudFormation
template as JSON and asserts the snapshot to match the existing snapshot. It is all just a few lines of code.

### **Visual Infrastructure Changes**

One of the most powerful features of snapshot tests is their integration with version control systems. When you modify
your infrastructure code, the changes are reflected in the snapshot diff, making them clearly visible in pull requests.
This visual representation makes code reviews more effective â€“ your team can easily spot and discuss infrastructure
modifications before they reach production.

This is a real-world screenshot I have taken from a simple AWS Lambda timeout adjustment, but I think it is sufficient
to get the idea:

### **Guard Rails for Infrastructure Changes**

Snapshot tests act as a safety net, ensuring that all infrastructure changes are intentional. If you're updating an S3
bucket policy but accidentally modify the bucket's encryption settings, the snapshot test will catch this unintended
change. This protection is particularly valuable in large teams where multiple developers work on shared infrastructure
code.

### **Refactoring with Confidence**

When refactoring CDK constructs or reorganizing your infrastructure code, snapshot tests shine. They verify that your
refactoring efforts maintain the same CloudFormation output, even if the CDK code structure changes significantly. This
allows you to confidently modernize your infrastructure code without fear of accidental modifications to the deployed
resources.

### **Additional Benefits**

- **Documentation**: Snapshots serve as living documentation of your infrastructure, showing exactly what CloudFormation
  resources your CDK code generates

- **Cross-Stack Validation**: When testing entire stacks, snapshots help identify unintended changes in resource
  dependencies and cross-stack references

- **Learning Tool**: For developers new to CDK, examining snapshot diffs helps them understand how their code changes
  translate to CloudFormation changes

- **Compliance Verification**: Snapshots can help ensure that infrastructure changes comply with organizational
  standards by making all modifications visible and reviewable

## How do you write snapshot tests in AWS CDK?

While writing snapshot tests is straightforward, there's an important caveat when testing infrastructure with Lambda
functions. The generated CloudFormation template includes an `S3Key` property that contains a hash of your Lambda
function's code. This means that **every time you modify your Lambda code**, even without changing the infrastructure,
the snapshot test will fail because the `S3Key` hash changes. This isn't ideal when you only want to validate
infrastructure changes rather than code changes.

Fortunately, **snapshot serializers** provide a solution to this problem. Testing frameworks like
[Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#expectaddsnapshotserializerserializer) and
[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/snapshot#custom-serializer) support custom snapshot serializers that can modify how
the snapshots are generated. By implementing a serializer, you can **strip out code-dependent elements** like the
`S3Key` (which contains a hash based on the code) from the CloudFormation template before it's saved as a snapshot. This
ensures your tests only fail when there are actual infrastructure changes, not just Lambda code updates.

```typescript
// ./setup-after-env.ts

// include this in `setupFilesAfterEnv` in the Jest config.

import 'aws-sdk-client-mock-jest';

import { config } from '../../src/config';

const bucketMatch = new RegExp(`cdk-[0-9a-z]{9}-assets-${config.env.account}-${config.env.region}`);
const assetMatch = /[0-9a-f]{64}\.zip/;

/**
 * This is a custom snapshot serializer for the CDK.
 * It substitutes the bucket and asset zip parts with [ASSET BUCKET] and [ASSET ZIP] respectively.
 *
 * This ensures that the snapshot stays the same on asset changes.
 *
 * @see https://blog.bigbandsinger.dev/robust-cdk-snapshot-testing-with-snapshot-serializers#heading-making-snapshots-less-fragile-ftw
 */
expect.addSnapshotSerializer({
	test: (val) => typeof val === 'string' && (val.match(bucketMatch) != null || val.match(assetMatch) != null),
	print: (val) => {
		// Substitute both the bucket part and the asset zip part
		let sval = `${val}`;
		sval = sval.replace(bucketMatch, '[ASSET BUCKET]');
		sval = sval.replace(assetMatch, '[ASSET ZIP]');
		return `"${sval}"`;
	},
});
```

I should mention that I borrowed this serializer code from another blog post â€“ shout out to whoever wrote it! Sadly, the
original link isn't working anymore as I write this, but hey, credit where credit is due.

### What Does My AWS CDK and Snapshot Tests Workflow Look Like?

After initially creating your snapshot files (by running `jest --testMatch '**/*.snapshot.test.ts'` you will have to run
`jest --testMatch '**/*.snapshot.test.ts -u'` (notice the `-u` for â€œupdateâ€œ) to update them on subsequent changes to the
infrastructure.

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">I put my snapshot tests in files with the suffix <code>.snapshot.test.ts</code>which allows me to only run or update the snapshot tests by targeting them with the <code>testMatch</code> argument.</div>
</div>

Here's how I use snapshot tests in my workflow: When I modify infrastructure code, I first run the tests locally to
generate updated snapshots. I review these changes carefully, and if they match my intentions, I commit both the code
and updated snapshots together. Then I push to GitHub and create a PR. The CI pipeline runs the snapshot tests again,
verifying that everything matches â€“ this catches any unintended changes before they make it to production.

## Conclusion

Snapshot tests have become an essential part of my CDK development workflow. While they might seem unusual at first,
their ability to catch unintended infrastructure changes with minimal effort makes them incredibly valuable. Combined
with the custom serializer to handle Lambda code changes, they provide just the right level of protection without
getting in the way.

If you haven't tried snapshot testing in your CDK projects yet, I encourage you to give it a shot. The small upfront
investment in setting them up will pay off in confident infrastructure changes and more effective code reviews.
