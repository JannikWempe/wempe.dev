## My Notes

### E2 – How do I find an idea for founding, bootstrapping, or as a side hustle?

- Find a small niche that offers a large "piece of the cake"
  - For example, Plausible, Fathom, etc. vs. Google Analytics -&gt; Privacy, Simplicity
- Narrow down the niche, e.g., by geography, age, occupation, language, etc
- Ultra-small niche can be expanded later
- Helpful: Be part of the niche yourself (In which "bubble" / scene am I?)
  - What do people complain about? What are the pain points?
- Book recommendations: The Millionaire Fastlane, The Great Rat-Race Escape
- Definitely take your partner on the entrepreneurship journey

  - Why do I want this? What do I imagine?

**Some Ideas**

- Website for sending faxes (including API)
- Content: Expert in something (e.g., software: Linear, Supabase, Auth0, ... or hardware: vacuum cleaner, stove,
  keyboard) -&gt; produce content and SEO affiliate and/or advertising
- Analytics for registered users (auth provider; dashboard):
  - When do users log in? How often? How long? Retention? Devices? Which login is used?
- Camera that streams a 24/7 food bowl (e.g., squirrel or bird) on Twitch, every tip = dispense food

### E3 – Don't start a side hustle without considering this!

- How much revenue do I need to make to work full time on my project? How many customers do I need at what price?

### **E5 –** 12 Startups and How They Can Get Their First Customer

| B2B                                  | B2C (other "Indie Hackers")         |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| "we"                                 | "I"                                 |
| professional                         | personal, sympathetic               |
| do not want to be the first customer | want to support other Indie Hackers |

- Niche first, then expand
- Focus on one social channel
- Where do the users hang out? Reddit? Twitter? Be active, build a reputation, don't sell directly
- Start with free, feedback is everything, make calls: "How are you currently doing it?", "What are your pain points?",
  Book: Mom Test
- Make a focused landing page, demos, GIFs, demo-account
- Exposure: post on Twitter, GIFs, using the tool, etc.

### **E6 –** Motivation: Stay motivated and keep motivating

- Where do I want to go? Work backward from the goal so I know what it's for
- Have a "compass"; not aimlessly in one direction
- What would my ideal daily routine look like if money wasn't an issue?
- If you enjoy the journey, you can achieve a lot. Reaching the goal gives a dopamine boost but quickly drops off; don't
  celebrate achieving goals too much

### E7 – Tips and methods for maximizing revenue

- Take the price you had in mind and double or triple it; people tend to lean towards pricing too low.
- No more than 3 tiers.
- Price the highest tier very high, so the middle one seems affordable (somewhat contradicts the popcorn pricing model
  in movie theaters).
  <Callout icon="⚠️">
  	This somehow contradicts the popcorn pricing model in cinemas: Pricing the high tier close to the middle tier so
  	that everybody thinks the top tier is a good deal because it is only slightly more expensive.
  </Callout>
- Experienced a significant revenue boost when prices were removed from the website (B2B); could set individual prices
  and adjust them constantly.
- Never offer "unlimited" of anything; it takes away the possibility of introducing higher tiers or add-ons.
- Better to be a boutique with fewer customers and higher prices; less effort for support, etc., and generally less
  stressful customers.
- Recommendation: [Designing the Ideal Bootstrapped Business with Jason Cohen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otbnC2zE2rw)

### **E8 –** Taking calculated risks as a small business owner

- There are many legal "hurdles"
- Not fulfilling everything from the beginning (e.g., cookie banner or correct legal notice/privacy policy); it's
  pointless if there are no customers yet; but it's a consciously taken risk
- These things are on the to-do list but don't have a high priority

### E9 – This is how bootstrappers survive and thrive despite recession

- Build cash reserves; save costs
- Invest in marketing to attract customers
- Reduce or stop discounts, as these customers often leave quickly, which is especially undesirable during a recession
- Additional revenue streams
- Increase prices

### E10 - Which business structure is suitable? My thoughts and my legal setup

- Sumit has a Holding (UG) & Incubator (UG) & Parquet (GmbH)

  [![Diagram of a holding structure (UG) with a company (GmbH) and an incubator (UG) below it. Investments are made in the holding.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1692429638223/1f2f022d-d45c-4355-8a7f-4b8a64b83ce0.png)](https://whimsical.com/sk-legal-setup-9VZzEHVHNPantuxTMn6ncm?auto=format,compress&w=800&fit=fillmax)

- Exit the incubator in a timely manner, as otherwise, there will be high taxes (if approaching 10,000 EUR per month) or
  restructure the incubator and create a new one
- Holding also has real estate, investments, shares, etc.
- Real estate: The company can also buy property (can be purchased from the company's gross income) and rent it out
  cheaply (about 30% below market) to the owner
- GmbH for the company when partnerships are important (reputation); with Parquet: with banks
- Sumit would always go directly for UG instead of GbR if serious
- Holding structure is only worthwhile if serious and initially comes with costs (e.g., for tax consultants)
- If planning to emigrate, a different setup is better (with GmbH & Co. KG)
- YouTube recommendation: [Warum die DOPPELTE HOLDING die beste Rechtsform ist! Steuerberater Christoph Juhn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmRd506tPK0)
  (the channel in general)

### **E11 –** How I set personal and business goals + my 2023 goals

**Personal**

- lifetime goals, have North Stars
- "shoot for the stars and reach the moon" (not necessarily for habits)
- build habits
  - start small, e.g. create time and go to bed early before a huge morning routine, or go to the gym first instead of
    training for 1 hour 5x a week right away
- when the habit is established
  - already "on-track"
  - maybe more challenges, e.g. 200kg deadlift, or running a marathon etc.

**Business**

- not directly targeting revenue or profit
  - can favor bad decisions
- Goals that favor good decisions and indirectly lead to profit, e.g. number of customers

### E14 – 6 Reasons Why You Haven't Started Your Business Yet

**1) Legal hurdles: Register trademark? Start a company?**

- First focus on initial customers
- Some legal things can be focused on later (e.g. cookie banner)
- A corporation can be backdated (but invoices already issued)
- Just get started

**2) Imposter: Me/Product not enough**

- It's good enough for someone; it doesn't have to be the best
- Big-Bang a la Apple products not good for bootstrappers; start imperfectly

**3) Fear that idea will be stolen**

- The idea on its own has no value, execution matters
- Hundreds of others probably have the same idea; but who implements it?
- Don't be afraid of building in public

**4) Can't build the product / I lack a skill**

- No money yet to hire a developer or similar
- 2 options:
  - Learn it yourself
  - Co-Founder
- 2 important skills needed: Tech + Sales/Marketing

**5) Have many ideas & can't decide**

- Possibly test 12 startups in 12 months or similar; ideas with product-market fit will emerge
- Again: Idea has no value without execution
- Just start with one

**6) Don't know if anyone would buy it / if the idea makes sense**

- Validate product beforehand
- Book "The Mom Test"
- Don't ask friends & family if the idea is good
- The best validation is payment data; possibly collect payment data on a landing page until enough is available and
  then start
- Instead of asking if the idea is good / makes sense, ask questions about the problems to be able to offer a better
  solution

### E15 – Open Startup: Advantages, Disadvantages - is the era over?

**Open Startup:** Sharing company metrics openly (e.g. revenue, profit, churn, MRR, employee salaries, etc. etc.). Not
everything needs to be published; for example, Parqet does not publish churn.

Example company: [Ghost](https://ghost.org/open/)

**Advantages**

- Trust
- Accountability
- Community
- Content

**Disadvantages**

- Encouragement for copy-cats & competitors
- Insights that competitors can use
- With poor numbers: harmful to trust

TLDR; Advantages outweigh disadvantages, especially in the beginning. Eventually, disadvantages increase and advantages
decrease.

### **E16 –** Successful Side-Hustle: Time Management Strategies for Entrepreneurs

- Know your "Why": Extra income? A salary increase would be easier. As a first step into full-time business? What should
  your ideal day look like?
- Get your partner on board; partner must know the "Why". There will be sacrifices (in relationships, etc.) to
  start/grow the side hustle.
- Use the time when you have energy and leave the employer "the rest"; better to hustle before work rather than after
  with the remaining energy.
- Where does the time come from?
  - Reduce consumption time; possibly go to bed earlier if unproductive in the evenings and then get up earlier.

### **E17 –** Top Business Models for Solopreneurs or Solo-Founders

- It doesn't have to scale exclusively through time; not 10x income through 10x time; there's a limit
- B2C is more difficult than B2B, as customer support can consume a lot of time
- boutique more suitable than cheap
- Suitable: content (newsletter, YouTube, blog), affiliate, SaaS, plugins (e.g. WordPress, Shopify, etc.)
